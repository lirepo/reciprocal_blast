* Reciprocal BLAST 

A python script to perform reciprocal BLAST searches on multiple genomes.

** Introduction
Reciprocal BLAST is a common computational method to identify putative
orthologs. Given a gene /g_a/ in an organism /A/, to find its potential ortholog

in another organism /B/, the reciprocal BLAST is done as follows.

1. The sequence of /g_a/ is BLASTed to the database of genes in organism /B/.
2. The best hit /g_b/ (the highest scoring gene in /B/) is BLASTed back to the
   database of organism /A/'s genes. If the best hit in the second BLAST is to
   the original gene /g_a/, it is concluded that the genes /g/ and /g_b/ are
   orthologs.
